// This header file you are reading needs to be included before ROS headers, because ROS melodic
// currently expects boost 1.65 (http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html), whereas Isaac has
// boost 1.68.

// With boost 1.67, boost::prior class used by ROS moved from boost/utility.hpp to
// boost/next_prior.hpp. To avoid compilation errors such as
//    "boost/range/iterator_range_core.hpp:323:24: error: 'prior' is not a member of 'boost'"
// we need to include "boost/next_prior.h" before ROS headers.
#include "boost/next_prior.hpp"

// Overwrite the boost version to avoid compilation errors such as
//    "error: 'class boost::detail::interruption_checker' has no member named 'unlock_if_locked'"
#undef BOOST_VERSION
#define BOOST_VERSION 106501
