Using a Jupyter Notebook with Isaac
-----------------------------------

Follow the directions at https://docs.nvidia.com/isaac/isaac/doc/setup.html to install Isaac SDK
dependencies and install the Isaac Python package for your workstation.

Navigate to `./apps/tutorials/jupyter_notebook/` and run `jupyter notebook isaac_notebook.ipynb`.

Your web browser should open the Jupyter notebook document. If it does not, search for a link on the
console. It will look like `http://localhost:8888/?token=<very_long_token_as_a_hex_number>`. Open
that link in your browser.

The Jupyter notebook document has a tutorial embedded within. Follow along and play with the cells
as you go.
