Isaac Webinar
----------------------------------


We recommend attending the `introductory Isaac webinar <https://info.nvidia.com/creating-intelligent-machines-with-the-isaac-sdk-reg-page.html>`_.
By attending this webinar, you will learn how to:

* Program a basic Isaac codelet to control a robot.
* Create a robotics application using the Isaac compute-graph model.

Note that the Webinar above is outdated but the core explanation is still valid.
You can also find two more recent webinars on the `Downloads <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/downloads&sa=D&ust=1606160270754000&usg=AOvVaw25Ge9gVtyiyLfZ0xKlDlVx>`_
page. The first is an Isaac SDK for Robotics overview, and the second is a technical webinar
in which you will learn the following:

* Train a 3D pose estimation network (an Isaac GEM) using Isaac Sim.
* Deploy a 3D pose estimation network on Jetson AGX Xavier.
* Build robotics apps in Isaac and ROS using ROS camera driver Nodes and Isaac perception GEMS
  (all in a simulated factory of the future).
* Understand an end-to-end description of application graph flow with Isaac GEMs in Isaac Sim.

The :ref:`building_apps_tutorial` tutorial also provides a written walk through of building apps
with code examples from Isaac SDK.
